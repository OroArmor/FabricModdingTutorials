# Setup

This tutorial will go over setting up your computer to create your first Minecraft mod. 
While no programming is done in this tutorial, proper setup is important and will prevent many hardships and issues down the line. 
It will also be assumed that you have a basic knowledge of Java in future tutorials, so a tutorial like [MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) will be extremely useful for future tutorials.

The different sections are 
1. IntelliJ - Install and configure IntelliJ
2. Git and Github - Install, create, and download your mod project
3. Importing to IntelliJ - How to import and run your project from IntelliJ
