# IntelliJ and MC Development

## IntelliJ

IntelliJ is an IDE created by JetBrains. 
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, and is software designed to make programming as easy as possible. 
Features that IDEs often have are ways to compile all the code with the press of a button and to help complete code with valid suggestions. 

IntelliJ can be downloaded for all major operating systems from [IntelliJ Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and has a free community version. The Ultimate version can be installed for free with a valid student account.

While other Java IDEs can be used to create Fabric Mods, IntelliJ is the best IDE for it, as it has the Minecraft Development Plugin, and the integration with Gradle, a Java build tool that Fabric uses is better than other IDEs.

## Minecraft Development Plugin

The Minecraft Developement Plugin, also known as MCDev is a community made plugin for IntelliJ that provides many useful error checking features for many different modding platforms. 

To install the plugin, click on `File -> Settings` in IntelliJ. 
A box will open and there should be a `Plugins` option on the left to be selected, then make sure that `Marketplace` and not `Installed` is selected on the top. 
In the search bar, type `Minecraft` and MCDev should be the first plugin to show up. 
Click install next to the name.
