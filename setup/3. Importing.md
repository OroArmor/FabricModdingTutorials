# Importing your Project

## Importing into IntelliJ

If you followed the `Cloning from your IDE` step in the `Git and Github` tutorial, you can skip ahead to `Launching Minecraft`.

Otherwise, if you downloaded the ZIP or cloned your project with git manually, open IntelliJ.
A window will open with an option to `Open or Import`. Select this and click on the folder where your project is in. 
The folder you click on should have files like `build.gradle` and a folder named `src` in it. Do not select the folder above your project 

The above process can also be done if IntelliJ already has a project open, by clicking `File` and then `Open`

IntelliJ will begin importing your project and downloading the files needed to mod. This may take several minutes to half an hour depending on how good your computer is.

## Launching Minecraft

Once the project is fully imported with no issues, click on `Edit Configurations` on the top toward the right side. 
This will open a window, where you should click the `Application` dropdown, then `Minecraft Client`, and then `OK` in the bottom right.
Now click the green triangle next to where you selected `Edit Configurations`, and Minecraft should launch.
